# My github website

[This website](https://chloevincent.github.io/) presents articles on how I solved some issues in LaTeX and R during my MA. It also documents tutorials I follow to learn about new technologies.

My most recent example of learning-by-doing is a Django app I created and deployed on Google Cloud: [chloe-django-blog.appspot.com](http://chloe-django-blog.appspot.com/).

[This website](https://chloevincent.github.io/) was created for personal use. It contains explanations on how to do stuff I spent some time doing myself. This way I can easily find documentation on problems I stumbled upon before.
