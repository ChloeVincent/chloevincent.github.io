If the terminal is frozen `Ctrl+q` may defreeze it ! To freeze it `Ctrl+s` (useful when the terminal is going to fast for you to read).

`Ctrl+R` for searching in the latest commands.

`Ctrl+A` to jump to the start of the line.

`#` to comment a command (useful if you spent time searching for it and want to keep it close)
