I am about to start a PhD on Antisemitism Online.

I am a software developer who just finished an [MA Linguistics][ma-github] at Queen Mary University of London. 
This blog presents articles on how I solved some issues in LaTeX and R during my MA.
It also documents tutorials I follow to learn about new technologies.

My most recent example of learning-by-doing is a Django app I created and deployed on Google Cloud: chloe-django-blog.appspot.com. 
It is now available at [chloevincent.pythonanywhere.com][cv-pa], since the Google Cloud free trial ended and the SQL database has been stopped.

This website was created for personal use. It contains explanations on how to do stuff I spent some time doing myself. This way I can easily find documentation on problems I stumbled upon before.
